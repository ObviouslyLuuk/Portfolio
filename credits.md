- My first and main source of knowledge about neural networks was the video series by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).
- Gaps in knowledge, especially about DQNs were filled mostly by [deeplizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrBUkpiRvCA).
- Of course I took the cartpole environment from [OpenAI Gym’s github](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py) and ported it from python to JavaScript.
- Frank Poth’s [video on games in JavaScript](https://youtu.be/w-OKdSHRlfA) was used for the real time engine and general code organization/layout (unrelated to AI).
- I was inspired by the popular and casual AI YouTube channel [CodeBullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r428O_CMcpI) for the racer idea.
- I used Chart.js for the line charts tracking the score, and simplebar.js for a pretty scrollbar. Bootstrap was also used for general css.
